PARAMETER file:

The directory must contain a file called parameters.txt.  This file includes a
pair of lines for each variable.  The first line gives the name and the second
gives the value.  The following must be present:

file1:  Name of the first snapshot

file2:  Name of the second snapshot

output: Name of the output snapshot

R1:  Radius of the first body

R2:  Radius of the second body

Relative velocity (in cm/s)

Impact parameter:  shift in the y-direction of the second body, given as a
fraction of the sum of the radii

Initial seperation (in cm)

Radius beyond which to identify as crust for first body: 0 to ignore

Crust radius for second body: 0 to ignore

IDSKIP


OUTPUT:


This program will take file2 and shift it in the y-direction by the specified
impact parameter, in the x-direction by the initial seperation, and give the
body the specified relative velocity
