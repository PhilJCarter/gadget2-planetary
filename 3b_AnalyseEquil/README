Analyse

Used to output radial profiles & speed/acc vs time relationships from snapshots
outputted by a version of Gadget2 edited by RAM & JMAA. This code written by
JMAA. Requires the edited version of Gadget2 (which should come with an
extensive readme by JMAA) - if you do not have that then this code will need
editing for it to work for you. eos_table_interp.c based on the one by RAM.

Input - directory of snapshot outputs of Gadget in the Gadget binary format
with Internal Energy replaced with Entropy & dS/dt replaced with Internal
Energy (see Gadget2 readme). This code only reads data from "gas" particles

Output - ascii tables of:
* Mean particle speed & acceleration vs. snapshot number
* Radial profiles (variable vs. radius) for the following quantities for each
snapshot:
  # Temperature
  # Density
  # Pressure
  # Internal Energy
  # Entropy


PARAMETER FILE (analyse.param is example):
Format is ascii, 2 lines per parameter, first is ignored by the code & is used 
to describle the paramter, second is its value in an appropriate format - see 
the example. They must come in the following order:

* directory of snapshot files - Input directory. As with all directories in 
  this parameter file must NOT come with a trailing /

* speed & acceleration output - output file for mean speed & acceleration data

* radial profiles output dir - a directory that must then contain 5 more 
  directories: tprofiles, rhoprofiles, pprofiles, uprofiles, sprofiles

* outer radius - in cm. Required to split the snapshots into radial bins

* number of materials

* EOS table base name - If k is the material number (least digits integer) then
  the EOS table filenames are: EOS_table_base_name+k+".txt"

* Number of radial bins to use - number of radii to use for radial profiles

* Average over particles in bin? - 1 for yes, 0 for no

* Number of particles to average over in bin - 0 means all of them

* T-profile base name

* Rho-profile base name

* P-profile base name

* U-profile base name

* S-profile base name

* Snapshot file base name - required to identify files in the input dir that 
  are snapshots, therefore must be unique to snapshot files

* ID skip - used to identify particle material from ID, must match that used in
  eos.h of the modified Gadget2 & the code used to make the ICs for Gadget2



NOTES:
* Snapshot files should not have extensions, assumes that the last 3 digits of
  the filename are a snapshot number e.g. Gadget2's default output of the form:
  "snapshot_000"

* All values in snapshot files assumed to be in cgs units

* Speed & Acc file has columns: snapnumber averagespeed average acc. All
  separated by tabs

* EOS tables match those used for the modified Gadget2 (that is, the "inverted"
  ones). Ascii format with: 
  #Rho-values #S-values Rho-values S-values P-points(varying Rho at each S) T-points(varying Rho at each S) U-values(varying Rho at each S) V_s-values(varying Rho at each S)
  See the readme for modified Gadget2 for more details. All units in cgs.

* _HASU flag in globvars.h corresponds to having told Gadget2 to output
  rate of change of entropy at compile-time (in the Makefile) - see Gadget2
  readme for details.

* There is a decent amount of repeated code between functions in analyse.c
  if you want to siginificantly edit this I recommend that you coalesce 
  similar functions first
