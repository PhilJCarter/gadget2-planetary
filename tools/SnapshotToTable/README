SnapToTable - Takes a Gadget2 snapshot in the default binary format & converts
	      it into an ascii table suitable for plotting.

analysedir.py - Uses SnapToTable to convert an entire directory of snapshots
                to ascii tables containing certain columns

stiltsplot.py - Uses stilts (http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/stilts/) to plot
                an x-y cross-section through snapshot tables created with
		analysedir.py

Usage for each is gained by running:
./SnapToTable
python analysedir.py
jystilts stiltsplot.py

This readme focusses on SnapToTable - others are self-explanatory & in a state
of flux.


SnapToTable is very similar to "Analyse" in how it works, the code for reading
& interpreting the EOSs is identical (& based on that by RAM). To make it more
batch-friendly it was decided not to have a parameter file & to use flags in
globvars.h instead for many detailed options.
It is therefore recommended that you make the code afresh every time it is
used.

Note that when specifying a directory for any/all of these scripts it is
required that there is no trailing "/". TODO: add a check so this requirement
is no longer needed. Also, the scripts assume running on Unix
