EscapingParticles

This code takes output from Gadget2 (native snapshot file) and gives an
estimate as to which particles are escaping. This estimate is rough and first
order.

It will define a particle as escaping iff both of the two conditions are met:
1) Kinetic energy must exceed gravitational potential energy at that point
2) x.v >= 0 where x is the particle's position vector and v is the 
  velocity vector.

Usage:
./Escaping <snapshot file> <output file>


Output is an ascii list of particle ids that are escaping. Also prints a mass
fraction escaping to the stdout.


This code assumes that potential is outputted by Gadget2 (needs to be turned on
in the makefile) and that the snapshot is in only 1 file.
