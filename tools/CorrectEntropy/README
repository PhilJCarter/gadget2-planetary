CorrectEntropy

A code to take a pre-equilibrated planet snapshot, and output an initial
conditions file which a specific entropy profile.

Based on code from 4_Remove and 5_CombineBodies.

Reads in from a parameter file, which needs 3 parameters in 6 lines (odd
numbered lines are ignored & left for identifiers for the coming parameter).
Parameters are (in order): input snapshot file location, output IC file
location, location of entropy profile. Snapshot must be in Gadget type "1"
format. Makes multiple assumptions about the parameters used for Gadget
in making this snapshot e.g. no long ids, all "gas" particles, entropies
rather than internal energies.

Entropy profile must be of the following format in an ascii file:
[number of lines, n]\n
[radius]\t[entropy]\n  \
[radius]\t[entropy]\n   |
[radius]\t[entropy]\n   > n of these
[radius]\t[entropy]\n   |
[radius]\t[entropy]\n  /
Must be ordered for increasing radius.
