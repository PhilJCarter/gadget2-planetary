phasediagram.py

Takes an EOS table of the form used by Gadget2 (dependent variables in the
order: pressure, temperature, internal energy, sound speed) and outputs
a T against S diagram of isobars. Takes a parameter file as input.

Parameter file must be formatted with ignored lines between each value to be
read (to allow for identification). Parameters (in this order) are:
EOS file name
output table file name
output png file name
1 or 0 denoting whether max/min d2T/dS2 for each isobar are to be estimated 
and plotted
auxillary gnuplot script file name
auxillary "peaks" (d2T/dS2) table file name
min. S value to be plotted
max. S value
min. T value
max. T value
number of isobars to be drawn (approx) - zero means all of them
maximum pressure isobar (approx)
Sskip - the larger this is the more sparse the plot will be but the faster it
will run (integer)
1 or 0 denoting whether auxillary files are deleted when done with

Relies on having gnuplot installed and accessible by the command "gnuplot" also
will try to use Eye Of Gnome ("eog") to display resultant plots.

Output tables (ascii) have headings denoting their contents. Isobars are found
by using an "S_0" value of entropy and then running through each Rho value
in the table finding a corresponding pressure then recording the T values
for this pressure against all of the S values. Sskip denotes how many of these
S_0 values to be used. If a value is not in the table or cannot be extrapolated
or interpolated from it in a dumb fashion then "nan" is outputted. No isobars
with values exceeding the specified maximum of pressure will be plotted. Not
all isobars are plotted (as denoted by the parameter file) but the estimataed
peak 2nd derivatives will be plotted for all isobars calculated.
2nd derivatives included to aid finding of the phase boundaries.
