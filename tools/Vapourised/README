vapourised.py

A script taking the output of FindPeakPressure and a "bell curve" phase
boundary on a T-S diagram and esimates the vapourisation of all particles
based on their entropy & temperature at peak pressure. "bell curve" file
must be an ascii table suitable for plotting with gnuplot with the first
column being entropy values and the second temperature values.

Takes a parameter files with ignored lines before each read-in line to allow
for identification. Parameters come in the order:
bell curve table
output table of FindPeakPressure
output file
temperature of 1bar isobar in bell
material number

Code will assume that the material releases isentropically down to 1bar
pressure, and hence the temperature for the (horizontal) isobar at 1bar is
required to use the lever rule to estimate mass fraction of vapour in each
particle. Output is an ascii table containing the particle ids and mass
fractions.

Assumes that the phase boundary is a bell-shape, i.e. cuts the 1bar-temp 
ascending and then descending:

	/   A	|	  B      \
