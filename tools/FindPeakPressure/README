FindPeakPressure

Consisting of:
FindPeak
tracerevolution.py

FindPeak runs through a directory of Gadget2 snapshot files and outputs an
ascii table of various thermodynamic properties at peak pressure and
entropy for all particles. Currently this means:
Particle id, peak Pressure, Entropy at peak pressure, temperature at peak 
pressure, peak entropy, snapshot number at which peak pressure occurs, 
snapshot for peak entropy, material. In that order of column.
This is a very slow code for large outputs.
Takes an ascii parameter file as input which must be formatted with ignored
lines before each read-in value (to allow for descriptions). The parameters,
in order, are:
input directory (must not have a trailing "/"), output file, number of 
materials, equation of state table base name, snapshot file base name,
idskip (matching that of eos.h in Gadget2).
EOS tables must be of the same form taken by Gadget2 with dependent variables 
in order: Pressure, Temperature, Internal Energy, Sound Speed. Files must be 
named: eostablebasename#.txt


tracerevolutions.py takes a list of particle ids used as "tracer" particles
and outputs tables of various thermodynamic properties against snapshot
number. Output files are put in a specified directory and named 
[variable]evolution.txt. Input file is an ascii list of particle ids separated
by newline characters. Must be pointed at an input directory containing 
ascii tables derived from Gadget2 snapshots (e.g. by SnapshotToTable)
