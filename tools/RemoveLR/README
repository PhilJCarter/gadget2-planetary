03/07/16 - PJC - Updated to give mantle/core/crust masses. Potential minimum method for higher
remnants does not necessarily get them in mass order, so can stop too early.

THIS CODE IS UNFINISHED.
THE CODE IN bound.c ESPECIALLY NEEDS TO BE CONVERTED SO THAT ONLY THOSE PARTICLES CURRENTLY
UNBOUND CAN BE ADDED TO THE NEW BOUND REMNANT
